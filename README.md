## Summary

Looking at the percent of 5-star reviews for these products, it would seem that there is not positive bias resulting from participation in the paid review program given that both paid and unpaid reviews result in about 44% of reviews being 5-stars. I would recommend a further analysis of the distribution of stars for those both in and out of the program to determine if there is a positive bias skewing results away from 1 or 2 star reviews.
